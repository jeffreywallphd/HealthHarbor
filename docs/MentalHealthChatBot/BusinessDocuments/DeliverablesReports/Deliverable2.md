## Mental Health ChatBot Deliverable 2

## Sprint 2 - Deliverable Report

## Team Name: Mental Health ChatBot

## Date: 02-20-2024

## Overview
* In the second sprint of the Mental Health Chat Bot project, our primary focus was on advancing technical development, improving the user interface (UI), and actively engaging with potential users. A key objective was to harness the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced natural language processing, ensuring a more efficient and responsive interaction within the chatbot.
Deliverables:

## Technical Exploration:
* One key aspect of this sprint was researching the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with our Python backend. The research involved understanding how these advanced language models could be effectively incorporated to elevate the chatbot's conversational capabilities. This exploration not only aimed to improve the richness of interactions but also to ensure the chatbot's adaptability to a broader range of user inputs.

## UI Enhancement and Streamlining Development:
* Recognizing the importance of a visually appealing and intuitive user interface, the team dedicated efforts to enhance the chatbot's UI. Updates were successfully implemented, addressing not only aesthetic considerations but also focusing on improving the overall user experience.

* Concurrently, we delved into the challenge of converting Figma designs into code, seeking to streamline the UI development process. This initiative aimed to bridge the gap between design and implementation, ensuring efficient and cohesive UI development.

## Innovations in UI Development:
* A notable development during this sprint was the exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools for UI development with minimal coding. The team identified a promising tool that allows the creation of user interfaces through prompts, potentially revolutionizing the speed and efficiency of UI development. This innovative approach aligns with our commitment to optimizing development processes, ultimately saving time and resources.

## Customer Engagement and Feedback Collection:
* Understanding the critical role of user input in shaping the chatbot's features, a Google Form was meticulously prepared to collect initial customer ideas and requirements. The responses obtained form the basis for the ongoing customer discovery phase, a crucial step in tailoring the chatbot to the diverse needs and preferences of our target audience. This iterative feedback loop ensures that the product aligns closely with user expectations. Here is the link to the Google form Anonymous survey, we would appreciate your feedback.

## Business Plan Development:
* Concurrently, research commenced on the formulation of a comprehensive business plan. This includes assessing how much potential customers may be willing to offer for the product, and providing insights into viable pricing strategies and revenue projections. This strategic approach ensures that our project addresses the technical and user experience aspects and aligns with sustainable business practices.
