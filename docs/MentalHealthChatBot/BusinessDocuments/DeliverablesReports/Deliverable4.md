## Mental Health ChatBot Deliverable 4

## Sprint 4   - Deliverable Report

## Team Name: Mental Health ChatBot

## Date: 03-26-2024

## Overview
* Sprint 4 marked a significant phase in the development of our Mental Health Chatbot (MHCB) project, focusing on frontend UI enhancements, backend integration, research on technology integration, cost estimations, and customer feedback implementation. This report provides an overview of the activities undertaken, achievements made, challenges faced, and future directions identified during this sprint.

## Deliverables:
* Frontend UI Development:
During Sprint 4, we transitioned from using HTML files to developing a more dynamic and interactive UI using React JS for our MHCB application. The refactoring of React files allowed for improved user experience, responsiveness, and easier management of UI components. Additionally, we worked on updating the UI to reflect Phase II enhancements, focusing on user interface updates based on customer feedback and feature enhancements.

* Backend Integration:
A branch was created for Backend Integration that focuses on integrating the frontend React JS UI with the Node JS MHCB prototype. Research was conducted on best practices and methodologies for seamless integration, ensuring efficient communication between the frontend and backend systems.

* Research and Technology Integration:
A significant research was done to integrate React JS UI with Node JS MHCB prototype. This included exploring technology stack compatibility, API integration strategies, and learning curves for new technologies. The team engaged in discussions, knowledge sharing, and learning sessions to streamline the integration process and address technical challenges.

* Cost Estimations and Business Planning:
As part of sprint activities, detailed work was done on cost estimations for the MHCB project, aligning with decisions made during management team meetings. A general business plan was also developed, outlining project milestones, resource allocation, budget considerations, and revenue projections. This laid the groundwork for informed decision-making and project planning.

* Customer Feedback Implementation:
Input from customer responses was actively incorporated into feature updates and UI enhancements. The team ensured that customer feedback was analyzed, prioritized, and implemented to improve the chatbot's functionality, usability, and overall user satisfaction. Regular updates were made based on iterative feedback cycles.

* Team Collaboration and Reflection:
Team meetings were held regularly to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. Individual team members collaborated effectively, shared knowledge, and supported each other in resolving technical issues and implementing project tasks. A reflective session was conducted to review the changes made, assess the project's overall progress, and plan for the upcoming sprint.

## Reflection:
* Sprint 4 was a period of significant progress and collaboration, focusing on frontend UI development, backend integration, technology research, cost estimations, customer feedback implementation, and team reflection. Moving forward, the team will continue refining the UI, completing backend integration, finalizing cost estimations, and preparing for the next sprint's objectives as outlined in the project roadmap.

* Overall, Sprint 4 was instrumental in advancing the MHCB project and setting the stage for further development and refinement as we work towards delivering a comprehensive and effective mental health chatbot solution.

## Next Steps:
* The next steps for our Mental Health Chatbot (MHCB) project will focus on integrating our LLM (Large Language Model) with the frontend UI or user interface. This integration will be crucial in enhancing the chatbot's capabilities, improving response accuracy, and delivering a more personalized user experience. Additionally, we will continue making progress based on ongoing customer feedback to ensure that the chatbot meets user expectations and addresses their mental health needs effectively.

* Model Integration Planning: The team will initiate discussions and planning sessions to outline the integration process of the LLM model with the frontend UI. This includes identifying the necessary API endpoints, data flow between frontend and backend systems, and the implementation approach for model integration.

* Testing and Optimization: The integrated system will undergo rigorous testing to validate the model's accuracy, responsiveness, and performance within the frontend UI. Testing will include scenario-based testing, user flow testing, and performance testing to identify and address any issues or bottlenecks.

* Feedback Analysis: The team will analyze ongoing customer feedback received from user interactions with the chatbot. Feedback will be categorized, prioritized, and evaluated to identify common pain points, user preferences, feature requests, and areas for improvement.
Feature Prioritization: Based on feedback analysis, the team will prioritize features and enhancements that align with user needs and expectations. This prioritization will guide development efforts and ensure that user-centric improvements are implemented in subsequent sprints.

* Continuous Iteration: Agile methodologies will be employed to iteratively improve the chatbot based on customer feedback. Regular sprint cycles will involve implementing feedback-driven updates, testing new features, gathering user input, and iterating on improvements to deliver a continuously evolving chatbot solution.

* User Engagement Strategies: The team will also focus on strategies to enhance user engagement and retention. This includes implementing proactive user prompts, personalized recommendations, empathetic responses, and interactive features that encourage users to engage more deeply with the chatbot.
