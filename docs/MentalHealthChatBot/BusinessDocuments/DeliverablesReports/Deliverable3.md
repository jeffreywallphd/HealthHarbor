## Mental Health ChatBot Deliverable 3

## Sprint 3 - Deliverable Report

## Team Name: Mental Health ChatBot

## Date: 03-13-2024

## Overview
* Over the past three weeks, our team has made progress towards achieving the ultimate goal of the team that is creating a mental health chatbot. Successful creation of a prototype, research on integrating Node JS backend with LLM, and collaborative team meetings to streamline technical processes and Git workflows were some of the major events that happened over this sprint. The team also has actively engaged in customer discovery, conducting insightful interviews to inform the development process. Business case development saw updates and enhancements, considering valuable data from interviews. Moreover, the first phase of UI development reached completion, and research on frontend-backend integration is being conducted. Letâ€™s go through in depth of our collective efforts and individual contributions toward achieving the goals for this sprint. 

## Deliverables:

* Prototyping the Mental Health Chatbot: One of our primary achievements has been the successful creation of a prototype for the Mental Health Chatbot. This prototype serves as a foundational structure upon which we will build the functionalities to address patient inquiries, offer guidance, and monitor their mental health status.

* UI Development: The first UI phase of our project progressed smoothly, reaching its completion during this reporting period. This UI is still in progress to be updated for delivering an intuitive and user-friendly interface for our Mental Health Chatbot. Our team is also delved into researching the integration of frontend and backend components, ensuring a cohesive and efficient connection between the user interface and the underlying functionalities of the chatbot.

* Integrating Node JS Backend with LLM: A critical aspect of our project involves seamless integration between the Node JS backend and LLM (Large Language Model). Our team dedicated time to thoroughly research and understand the intricacies of this integration, laying a robust foundation for the technical aspects of our chatbot.

* Technical Team Collaboration and Git Processes:To ensure smooth collaboration within our technical team, we conducted a comprehensive team meeting. Discussions revolved around the technical side of the project, UI considerations, and effective Git processes. This collaborative effort aimed to streamline our development workflow. Individual team members also dedicated time to continuous learning and documentation. Updates to personal profiles on Github, connecting VS code, and participating in team meetings were integral to fostering a collaborative and informed work environment.

* Conflict Resolution and Code Management: An essential part of our progress involved resolving conflicts within the credit/debit team's code reviews. We established a new branch specifically for their work, facilitating seamless collaboration and handover of code. Multiple branches were reviewed, merged, and managed efficiently.

* Customer Discovery and Interview Sessions: Our team actively engaged in customer discovery, conducting and documenting interviews. Our team has interviewed around 5 customers, and insights from these sessions were crucial in understanding user needs and preferences. Noteworthy was the continuation of customer discovery, including sessions with new customers like Agaba.

* Business Case Development: We diligently worked on updating and enhancing our business case, considering valuable data obtained from customer interviews. The collaborative effort involved collating and analyzing all documented interviews to inform our strategic decisions for the project.
