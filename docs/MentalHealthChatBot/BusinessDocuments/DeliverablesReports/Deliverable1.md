## Report 1: Mental Health Chat Bot - Week 2 Progress

## Objective:
* The second week of our project focused on establishing the foundational aspects of our Mental Health Chat Bot. Our key priorities included setting up collaborative tools, exploring the project repository, designing the user interface, and making crucial decisions regarding programming languages for the front end, back end, and natural language model (LLM). Additionally, we began drafting interview questions to gather valuable insights from potential users about mental health.

## Achievements:
* GitHub Setup:
Every team member successfully created a GitHub account to facilitate seamless collaboration.
The project repository was cloned by all team members, ensuring a centralized platform for version control and collaborative development.

* Repository Exploration:
We dedicated time to familiarize ourselves with the structure and contents of the GitHub repository.
Understanding the repository will streamline collaboration and ensure everyone is on the same page regarding project components and progress.

* User Interface Design:
Collaboratively worked on the initial design of the Mental Health Chat Bot's user interface.
Considered essential features and user experience elements to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

* Programming Language Decisions:
Engaged in discussions to determine suitable programming languages for different components:
Front end: Exploring options such as Python, HTML, and CSS for an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
Back end: Decided on using Django for its robust features, scalability, and ease of integration.
LLM: Began exploring options and considerations for the natural language model that will power the chat bot's responses.

* Interview Question Drafting:
Drafted a preliminary set of interview questions aimed at understanding user needs, preferences, and expectations concerning mental health chat bots.
Questions cover a range of topics, including preferred communication styles, desired features, and potential concerns regarding mental health discussions.
