## Executive Summary: 
* The goal of the Mental Health Chatbot project is to meet the growing need for easily available, individualized mental health assistance. This will use artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide participants with the information and abilities they need to use chatbots for mental health management. With the help of interactive exercises, training materials, and real-world scenarios, participants will become more comfortable using chatbot solutions that are customized to meet their individual needs. 
## Business Overview: 
* The chatbot will be available online so it can be accessed through our special platform. Features will include how to communicate with chatbots effectively, how to use chatbots for self-care, and how trustworthy mental health chatbot platforms will all be covered in the program. Those looking for accessible and alternative ways to manage their mental health, such as those dealing with anxiety, stress, depression, or mood disorders, will be able to get answers to their health issues on the platform. 
## Market Analysis: 
* Industry Trends: 
    - As mental health concerns become more widely recognized and less stigmatized, the mental health sector is going through an evolutionary shift in favor of digital solutions. ● A growing number of people are using chatbots to get mental health support because they are affordable, accessible, and anonymous. 
## Target Audience: 
* We primarily target those who are comfortable with computers, between the ages of 18 and 35, and who are looking for easily available mental health information. ● Employers who want to provide mental health support to their staff and medical professionals who want to include digital solutions into their workflows make up our secondary audiences. 
## Competitive Landscape: 
* Similar online programs and services emphasizing self-care and mental health awareness are provided by market rivals still in operation. 
* We have a unique market potential since, surprisingly, not many competitors explicitly target the use of chatbots for mental health support.
## Product Description: 
* Chatbots are an emerging technology that show potential for mental health care apps to enable effective and practical evidence-based therapies. As this technology is still relatively new, little is known about recently developed apps and their characteristics and effectiveness. We conducted an exploratory observation of 10 apps that offer support and treatment for a variety of mental health concerns with a built-in chatbot feature and qualitatively analyzed 3621 consumer reviews from the Google Play Store and 2624 consumer reviews from the Apple App Store. We found that although chatbots’ personalized, humanlike interactions were positively received by users, improper responses and assumptions about the personalities of users led to a loss of interest. As chatbots are always accessible and convenient, users can become overly attached to them and prefer them over interacting with friends and family. Furthermore, a chatbot may offer crisis care whenever the user needs it because of its 24/7 availability, but even recently developed chatbots lack the understanding of properly identifying a crisis. Chatbots considered in this study fostered a judgment-free environment and helped users feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information.
