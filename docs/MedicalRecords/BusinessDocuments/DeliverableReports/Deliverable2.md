### Overview

**Sprint Goals**:
1. Finalize the UI flowcharts.
2. Understand how FHIR can be mapped to the features in our flowchart.
3. Conduct the first interview for each team member.

**Deliverables**:

- **Product Design**: Describe the progress made in designing and prototyping features or components.
  - A UI meeting was scheduled and set for the day after the sprint ends, this will allow us to improve our prototype and be aligned with the other teams.

- **Management Structures and Policies**: Detail any enhancements or adjustments made to the team's management structures and policies to optimize collaboration and productivity.
  - The team is starting to become more familiar with Agile management practices. Jira is being used regularly by all team members and the Product Owner and Scrum Master are working to grow and refine the backlog. The team has regularly scheduled stand up meetings both during class time and after hours. These have been scheduled using Google Calendar. This has provided some challenges as not everyone on the team is currently using a single calendar to track all their commits. Additionally, the team finished their first retrospective and sprint planning meetings. Per Jeff’s request the Scrum Master is taking note of attendance and will report results to the Project Manager.
  - In addition to our regularly scheduled stand up meetings, the team has created several new communication threads in Discord to further organize thoughts, documentation, and discussion on the key areas of the team's work. So far, the team has created four threads within the Medical Records team chat: Jira, FHIR, Interviews, and Pull Requests. We have found that these separate communication channels help to stay organized and avoid overlapping conversations within the same channel.
  - The team also had an in-class discussion regarding our experience with the first wave of interviews. From this discussion, there were suggestions for reworded questions, adding additional questions and connecting dialogue, and confirmation of well-constructed formatting and interview flow.

- **Project Plan**: Outline the team's Agile project plan, including updates to user story backlogs, Kanban boards, or other planning tools. Discuss any modifications made based on evolving project needs.
  - *Discuss the meetings/work conducted outside of class that relates to this section*
  - Adam Hobson and Kian Sapali conducted an introductory meeting to discuss the team’s contributions to the overall Business Case document. The meeting included discussion of the planned features of the medical records portion of the product, the direction of the product’s near and distant future, and the finances that will likely be included in our project’s future.

- **User Interviews and Analysis**: Summarize the insights gathered from user interviews conducted during the sprint. Highlight key findings and how they informed design decisions.
  - *Interview findings summarized here.*

- **Prototype Development**: Provide an update on the progress of prototype development. Include any challenges encountered and how they were addressed.
  - *Progress on prototype development discussed here.*

- **Demos / Images**:

  - **Screenshots**: Attach screenshots or visual representations of the deliverables developed during the sprint.
    - *Interactive Medical Records Management Card on the existing product and Example Snippets from the Figma UI Mockup Flowcharts provided.*
  
  - **Demo Video**: If applicable, provide a demo video showcasing the functionality of the prototype or any interactive features implemented.
    - *No Demo Videos to provide for Deliverable 2.*

### Reflection and Next Steps

Throughout Sprint 2, our team faced some challenges stemming from interruptions caused by Winter Carnival and the Career Fair, as well as some difficulties scheduling meetings. Despite these obstacles, our team demonstrated resilience and dedication, making significant progress in several areas of the project.

One of our key successes during the sprint was the regular communication maintained both in-class and on Discord. This facilitated ongoing collaboration and ensured that everyone remained updated on the progress of the project. Additionally, our team made notable progress on the interviews. The interview protocol and questions were finalized as well as the team completed the first round of interviews. This will help to guide the development of the project.

Moving forward, we recognize the need to schedule meetings further in advance taking into consideration the setbacks caused by these disruptions. Our next sprint will include a one week pause for spring break. Our group will need to account for this during the sprint planning.

In terms of progress, we have made significant progress in understanding FHIR and have begun to develop the UI. This will lay a solid ground for future sprints to build upon.

Looking ahead, our team’s objectives will be as follows - 
- Create a landing page for the Medical Records with User Login.
- Completing the Appointment Scheduling Feature.
- Completing the Vitals Feature.

Leveraging the lessons learned in this sprint and maintaining a collaborative approach, I am confident that our team will continue to provide a high-quality product.
