**Interviewer:**  

## Introduction:

Good [morning/afternoon], _______! I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me! With your input, my team and I are hoping to develop a better understanding of the problem domain that we are trying to solve in our course project. Explain the goal of the health app and its integration with medical records. As a class, we are tasked with creating and developing a software called Health Harbour which has the vision to be a one-stop application to record and monitor all areas of personal health including Mental Health, Physical Health, Financial Health, and Medical Records. My team is in charge of the Medical Records feature of the software and we felt that you may be able to help us with our development. We also want you to know that this interview will be kept confidential. Our only motivation is to learn from a valuable perspective.

## Background Information:

First, I have some generic questions about yourself:

- What is your age?
- What is your gender?
- Tell me about your job and the main tasks you are responsible for.

## Experience with Health Apps:

- Tell me what your personal experience has been working with Electronic Medical Records (EMR) applications as a user. Which ones have you used?
- Tell me about some difficulties you have had working with EMR software. Why?
- Tell me about some characteristics of EMR software that you feel are necessary to have. Why?

## Privacy and Security:

- Tell me your views on privacy and security tools in different applications that you use on a regular basis. Do you feel they are important? Necessary?
- What would make you feel confident that your data is secure within any application that you use?
- What features would you expect an EMR application to have for secure data handling?

## Integration with Medical Records:

- What are your initial thoughts on our plan to integrate medical records software into our application using FHIR's external API?
- What concerns or hesitations do you have regarding our plan?

## App Usage Scenarios:

- Based on the description of our application, how would you personally use our software?
- What sticks out to you as our most beneficial feature?
- If any, what sticks out to you as a feature you possibly wouldn’t use?

## User Interface and Navigation:

- Tell me your thoughts on the design, layout, and functionality of our app’s prototype so far.
- Describe your thoughts on the navigation between and within features in our prototype.
- What features or details of our prototype do you like? Why?
- What features and/or details of our prototype do you think we should modify? How should we change them?

## Feedback on Specific Features:

- As you could see from the demo video, not all of the features we are planning to implement are developed yet. As we continue to develop and update our application, what ideas do you have in mind that could enhance our future features and user experience? [*APPOINTMENTS, MESSAGING, LAB RESULTS, MANUAL IMPORT*]

## Notifications and Alerts:

- For applications that you use regularly, what are the types of notifications or alerts that you appreciate?
- What are the types of notifications that you dislike?
- Tell me what notifications you think should be most important for an application like ours that involves scheduling, personal information, and medical records.

## Additional Suggestions:

- Are there any other suggestions, comments, or concerns about the app’s features or our implementation plan that you would like to discuss?

## Closing:

I really appreciate your time to meet with me today! Your perspective is very valuable to our team! As we continue to develop the app, we may have additional features or improvements to discuss. Would you be open to participating in a follow-up interview to share your thoughts on the updates and enhancements?
