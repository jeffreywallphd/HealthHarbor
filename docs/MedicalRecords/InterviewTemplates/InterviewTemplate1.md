## Introduction:

Good [morning/afternoon], _______! I really appreciate you taking the time to meet with me! With your input, we are hoping to develop a better understanding of the problem domain that we are trying to solve in our course project. Explain the goal of the health app and its integration with medical records. As a class, we are tasked with creating and developing a software called Personal Wellness Pod which has the vision to be a one-stop application to record and monitor all areas of personal health.

Some of the features include: Mental Health, Physical Health, Financial Health, and Medical Records. My team is in charge of the Medical Records feature of the software and we felt that you may be able to help us with our development.

We also want you to know that this interview will be kept confidential. Our only motivation is to learn from a valuable perspective.

## Background Information:

First, I have some generic questions about yourself:

- What is your age?
- What is your gender?
- Tell me about your job and the main tasks you are responsible for.

## Experience with Health Apps:

- Tell me what your personal experience has been working with Electronic Medical Records (EMR) applications. Which ones have you used?
- If not, will this proposed website/application be acceptable? Any comments.
- Tell me about some difficulties you have had working with EMR software. Why?
- Tell me about some characteristics of EMR software that you feel are necessary to have. Why?
- Are there any characteristics that you feel aren’t necessary? Why?
- Name a few features that you wish all EMR software had. Why?

## Privacy and Security:

- Tell me your views on privacy and/or security tools and features in different applications that you use on a regular basis. Do you feel they are important? Not important? Necessary? Not necessary?
- What would make you feel confident that your data is secure within an application that you use?
- What features would you expect an EMR application to have for secure data handling?

## Integration with Medical Records:

- Our temporary plan for integrating medical records software in our application is to use the external API reference (which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other) from Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR), which is a framework for storing and sending healthcare information. Currently, FHIR is already widely implemented in the medical industry. We want to channel FHIR’s external API because FHIR holds patient data, such as Appointment History, Medications, Care Provision, Nutrition Intake, Insurance Coverage, etc., that we envision needing in our application. It is also a free software to implement. What are your initial thoughts on this?
- What concerns or hesitations do you have regarding our plan? Where would you see us running into issues along the way?

## App Usage Scenarios:

Within the Medical Records feature of our application, we hope to be able to not only track manually inputted medical data from the user, such as uploaded documents and tracking personal health information, but also the ability to access test results, medical history, appointment scheduling information, and other records from all areas of our user’s medical history.

For example, here are some scenarios we see our customers using our app:

- [PULL USER SCENARIO FROM EXAMPLE DOCUMENT OR MAKE YOUR OWN].
- [PULL USER SCENARIO FROM EXAMPLE DOCUMENT OR MAKE YOUR OWN].
- [PULL USER SCENARIO FROM EXAMPLE DOCUMENT OR MAKE YOUR OWN].

Based on the description of our application, how would you personally use our software?
What sticks out to you as our most beneficial feature?
If any, what sticks out to you as a feature you possibly wouldn’t use?

## Closing:

I really appreciate your time to meet with me today! Your perspective is very valuable to our team! As we continue to develop the app, we may have additional features or improvements to discuss. Would you be open to participating in a follow-up interview to share your thoughts on the updates and enhancements?
