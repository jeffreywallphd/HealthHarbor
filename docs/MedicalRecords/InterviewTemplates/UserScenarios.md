# Example User Scenarios for Interview Dialogue

## Example 1:
After getting back my test/lab results, I want to make sure I can save this in the future for when I need to reference this again for my doctor or any medical forms that need this information. I will just upload the information into my Health Harbor app for safekeeping and easy access in the future.

## Example 2:
I can’t remember the name of the medications I was prescribed by my doctor from several years ago, but I need to know that information for this documentation I am filling out. Oh wait, I have access to that information in my Health Harbor app.

## Example 3:
I am a parent or legal guardian of 4 children and I am responsible for knowing each of their medical information, needs, appointment schedules, allergies, etc., but thanks to Health Harbor, I can keep it all organized in the same, safe area.

## Example 4:
My Physical Therapist is curious about all of my past medical history, but doesn’t have access to that information. Thanks to my Health Harbor application, I can access all of the needed information that I am willing to share.

## Example 5: 
As I was cleaning up the garage, I threw out my back while lifting something heavy. I knew I needed to schedule an appointment with my chiropractor so I opened my phone and checked my availability on my Health Harbor calendar. I then went to the scheduling feature of the Health Harbor app to make an appointment with my chiropractor for the next day in between my dentist appointment that I scheduled several months ago and my afternoon work meeting.

## Example 6:
I have been very itchy the last few days and there seems to be a rash forming on my arm. I am unsure of the severity of the rash and I want to chat with my doctor to see what they think. I opened up my Health Harbor app and went to the messaging feature. I promptly sent a message to my doctor with a picture of my itchy arm. I was notified that the message and picture were successfully sent and quickly received a message back.
