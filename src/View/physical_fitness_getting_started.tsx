        <p><em>(noun)</em> . /Àày≈ç…°…ô/<br/> </p><p>
            Yoga, derived from the Sanskrit word "Yuj" meaning union, is often interpreted as a means of achieving harmony with God, body, or mind. Regardless of the interpretation, it serves as an excellent starting point for those aiming to improve fitness.<br/><br/><br/>
            Engaging in yoga fosters a calm and centered mind, making it universally beneficial. Whether one is considering its suitability, the answer is unequivocally affirmative. Over time, yoga has diversified, offering numerous variations tailored to different needs.<br/><br/><br/>
            For instance, power yoga targets calorie burning, while traditional yoga emphasizes flexibility. Certain poses are also designed to alleviate specific pains. However, individuals with medical histories or physical conditions should seek professional advice before getting on with it.<br/><br/><br/>
            Despite its vastness, efforts are made to make yoga accessible to all. Even small amounts of practice contribute to progress, underscoring its inclusivity and adaptability.<br/><br/>
