## Installation
### Prepare to Install
* Choose an IDE (Integrated development environment) 
    - An IDE is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently. It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application
    - Suitable Options: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VSCode (My Preference)

### Install Git on your OS
* If you have a mac, there's a chance you may already have git installed
    - Run git --version to check
* If it tells you git is not installed then there are a couple ways to do it. 
* This link goes through the options for mac: https://macpaw.com/how-to/install-git-mac
    - If you have homebrew installed or install it, there are some very simple commands to install git and nodeJS. 
* For non-Mac users, [Download Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
* [Create GitHub Account](https://github.com/join)
    - Check that it is downloaded via command prompt/terminal: Run command ‘git --version’
* [Familiarize yourself with basic Git Commands](https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary#commands)
* Review the project documentation reguarding branching

### Download NodeJS
* [Download NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
* If you have a mac, you can either use the installer, use HomeBrew, or bash 
* To use HomeBrew run ‘brew install node’
* [Follow other guides on how to install NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)
* Check that it is downloaded via command prompt/terminal: Run command ‘npm -version’

### Pull the project repository from GitHub
* Click on the code button and copy the URL to clipboard  
* Run ‘git clone https://github.com/jeffreywallphd/PersonalWellnessPod.git’ in your command prompt/terminal or the terminal within your IDE
    - You want to run this command where you would like your project directory to be. You may want to create a folder for all your repositories, or put it in a folder for this class. 
* The package.json file is the central place to configure and describe how to interact with and run your application. This has been set up by the prior class. 
* You should be able to access the file at the very bottom of the directory. This file tells us to run a couple different scripts
* To start the site:
    - Run ‘npm start-frontend’ to just start the front end
    - Run ‘npm start-backend’ to just start the back end
    - To get the entire site up and running just run ‘npm start’ which runs both of those commands concurrently, most of you will just need to run this.
    - It may ask you to install a couple other things, just run the commands it tells you 
* it will say something like ‘Server running on http://localhost:8080’ and this should automatically open a new tab with the site running
