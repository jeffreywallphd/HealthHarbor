 * A Parser takes a string and generates {@link https://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/|RDF/JS Quads}.
 *
 * By providing an object conforming to the `Parser` interface, you can handle
 * RDF serialisations other than `text/turtle`, which `@inrupt/solid-client`
 * supports by default. This can be useful to retrieve RDF data from sources
 * other than a Solid Pod.
 *
 * A Parser has the following properties:
 * - `onQuad`: Registers the callback with which parsed
 * {@link https://rdf.js.org/data-model-spec/|RDF/JS Quads} can be provided to
 * `@inrupt/solid-client`.
 * - `onError`: Registers the callback with which `@inrupt/solid-client` can be
 * notified of errors parsing the input.
 * - `onComplete`: Registers the callback with which `@inrupt/solid-client` can
 * be notified that parsing is complete.
 * - `parse`: Accepts the serialised input string and an object containing the
 * input Resource's metadata.
 * The input metadata can be read using functions like [[getSourceUrl]] and
 * [[getContentType]].
 *
 * For example, the following defines a parser that reads an RDFa serialisation
 * using the
 * [rdfa-streaming-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rdfa-streaming-parser)
 * library:
 *
 * ```javascript
 * import { RdfaParser } from "rdfa-streaming-parser";
 *
 * // ...
 *
 * const getRdfaParser = () => {
 *   const onQuadCallbacks = [];
 *   const onCompleteCallbacks = [];
 *   const onErrorCallbacks = [];
 *
 *   return {
 *     onQuad: (callback) => onQuadCallbacks.push(callback),
 *     onError: (callback) => onErrorCallbacks.push(callback),
 *     onComplete: (callback) => onCompleteCallbacks.push(callback),
 *     parse: async (source, resourceInfo) => {
 *       const parser = new RdfaParser({
 *         baseIRI: getSourceUrl(resourceInfo),
 *         contentType: getContentType(resourceInfo) ?? "text/html",
 *       });
 *       parser.on("data", (quad) => {
 *         onQuadCallbacks.forEach((callback) => callback(quad));
 *       });
 *       parser.on("error", (error) => {
 *         onErrorCallbacks.forEach((callback) => callback(error));
 *       });
 *       parser.write(source);
 *       parser.end();
 *       onCompleteCallbacks.forEach((callback) => callback());
 *     },
 *   };
 * };
