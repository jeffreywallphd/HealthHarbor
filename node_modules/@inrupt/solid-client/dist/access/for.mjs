/**
 * Get an overview of what access is defined for a given set of actors: all Agents
 * or all Groups.
 *
 * This function works with Solid Pods that implement either the Web Access
 * Control spec or the Access Control Policies proposal, with some caveats:
 *
 * - If access to the given Resource has been set using anything other than the
 *   functions in this module, it is possible that it has been set in a way that
 *   prevents this function from reliably reading access, in which case it will
 *   resolve to `null`.
 * - It will only return access specified explicitly for the given actor (Agent
 *   or Group). If additional restrictions are set up to apply to the given Agent
 *   in a particular situation, those will not be reflected in the return value
 *   of this function.
 * - It will only return access specified explicitly for the given Resource.
 *   In other words, if the Resource is a Container, the returned Access may not
 *   apply to contained Resources.
 * - If the current user does not have permission to view access for the given
 *   Resource, this function will resolve to `null`.
 *
 * @param resourceUrl URL of the Resource you want to read the access for.
 * @param actorType type of actor whose access is being read.
 * @returns What access is set for the given resource, grouped by resp. Agent or Group.
 * @since 1.5.0
 *
 * @hidden
 * @deprecated Access Control Policies will no longer support vcard:Group. Use the mechanism-specific access API's if you want to define access for groups of people.
