 * - Use [[overwriteFile]] to save the file. [[overwriteFile]] creates

 *
 * Users who only have `Append` but not `Write` access to a Container
 * can use [[saveFileInContainer]] to save new files to the Container.
 * That is, [[saveFileInContainer]] is useful in situations where users
 * can add new files to a Container but not change existing files in
 * the Container, such as users given access to send notifications to
 * another's Pod but not to view or delete existing notifications in that Pod.
 *
 * Users with `Write` access to the given folder/Container may prefer to
 * use [[overwriteFile]].

 * @param options Additional parameters for file creation (e.g. a slug).
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to the saved file, if available, or `null` if the current user does not have Read access to the newly-saved file. It rejects if saving fails.
